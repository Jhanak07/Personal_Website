            description: "With thousands of applications for a particular job posting, it is evident that the competitive job market demands an efficient resume parsing tool. Our project focuses on developing an AI-driven resume parsing tool, ”CVSmart ” to support the resume evaluation process.The key motivation behind the project is to understand the challenges faced by both job seekers and recruiters due to the overwhelming application responses to job applications. As applicants, you cannot wait for months to hear back and at the same time as employers it is really difficult to grade thousands of resume effectively. We utilize Python as our primary coding language for the project. We have utilized spaCy NLP library to process resumes from various formats. The key methodologies include employing K-means clustering algorithm ( an unsupervised machine learning algorithm) to break down resume data into meaningful clusters and spaCy’s word embedding and TF-IDF techniques for vectorization. The project demonstrates real world applications for the AI in HR industry as well as an efficient tool for job seekers to understand their resume.",

            title: "Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning Algorithm",
            description: "Places like warehouses require extensive use of physical labor in moving things around. If we think of ways to revolutionize the way things work by automating simple tasks such as moving and having humans do more complex tasks. Warehouses are of vital importance for e-commerce businesses which are growing exponentially.  Places like the warehouses of Amazon, where packages need to be moved constantly and with utter responsibility to ensure smooth working of the unit, robots can be a very effective way to make the process easier. Training robots to take boxes from one place to another in different situations can help us reduce the physical labor. We can also train the robots to not come in each other's way. In this research project, I am planning to train robots to move objects such as large boxes to be moved from one place to another in a defined path without colliding with each other.. To work on this approach, I plan on using two different techniques and comparing them to know which one is more effective. ",

Using Python's Pandas library, I analyzed a dataset detailing the number of men and women in tech. By applying various machine learning algorithms, I identified patterns and calculated the gender ratio. A significant finding was the spike in women leaving the industry between ages 24-27, often coinciding with life events like marriage and starting a family. This project highlights the importance of data-driven insights in understanding workforce trends and the challenges women face in tech.",
